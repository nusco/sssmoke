# Sssmoke

Slap Ruby scripts on a web server in seconds.

## Installation

    gem install sssmoke

## Usage

Put your erb templates in a directory, then run them in a web server by typing:

    sssmoke

A template named `foo.erb` will get the URL `http://localhost:8888/foo`.

## Pro Usage for Powah Usahs

    sssmoke directory_name      # sssmoke templates from another directory
    sssmoke template_name.erb   # sssmoke a single template at http://localhost:8888/

That's all. (As to the reason why it's called "Sssmoke"- that story would be better told in person.)
